Goals
-----

- Learn about web-scraping and creating datasets. hows and whys
- Learn more about python in general
- Use Bs4 and Requests to do this
- Build some kind of small CLI to look at dataset
- Get the data into some flavor of SQL database
- Next time create this file BEFORE starting the project >.<

Tech
----

- Python
  - Beautiful Soup 4
  - Requests

Notes/Thoughts/Plans
--------------------

+ script
  - Club-mst3k.com will be my source
  - would be cooler if it was putting info into sql database instead of JSON although that might not really be necessary
  - try a second iteration with oop in mind
    - could perhaps make something less coupled to this project for use in the future
  - scrape every episode title of MST3k for all original 10 seasons along with associated short films and all user submitted 'best riffs' from the site
    - make a single request to gather all the links on the site
    - find the links for each episode
      - for each of these links make a request and gather the 'best riffs' from the comment section

+ CLI
  - would be cooler if it just let you make sql queries
  - made it super simple, it exists just to test the collected data
  - when asked for a season/episode combo it returns the episode title, whether or not there is a short, if so which one(s), and also prints a random riff from that episode.
  - handles common errors

+ API
  - Maybe in the future write an API so that people can request a random quote from a specific season/episode of MST3K
  - could make a game where users can attempt to guess what movie a quote is from
    - lots of potential problems here but could be really fun mst community game.


new oop ideas
--------------

-generic scraper class
  - scrape home page class
    -all seasons
    -all movie titles
    -all associated shorts if any
  - scrape each movie page class
    -qoutes

-'bot' class to manage scrapers and store info
